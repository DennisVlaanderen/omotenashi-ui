# Omotenashi UI

This repository is home to the NextJS Front-End of Omotenashi. 
Omotenashi is a tenant maintenance kit designed to be extended upon.
It will provide basic support for multi-user administration, maintaining multiple-tenants, settings up rights for tenants, 
assigning user credentials to tenants as well as maintainance for rights for individual users belonging to a tenant.

This project is currently a work-in-progress with no support.
The project will remain open-sourced and ready for modification by any third party.

## Contribute

Due to the small size of the project in it's current state we are not looking for any further collaborators.
In case you do wish to build upon this code-base, feel free to fork this repository and modify it to your own heart's content.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Finishing up Basic UI Layout
- [ ] A single-purpose connector to handle CRUD on an external API
- [ ] Safe management of user-credentials in browser storage
